# BikeShare
This is my code to do the Kaggle Bike Sharing Demand Competition. In this competition, we were given both historical data and weather information and were tasked with predicting the Bike Demand (or number or bikes) rented on a particular day in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C. The purpose of participating retrospectively in this competition was to learn predicictive models for predicting a continuous response variable, in this case predicting a count. Feature engineering and model tuning were explored in several different models including BART, Regression Trees, Random Forests, and Stacking. The models were evaluated under Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE) and my model that performed best was BART with a score of 0.389 which in regards to the leaderboard would be the 155th best score out of 3243 submissions.
